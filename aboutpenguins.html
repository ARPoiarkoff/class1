        <h1 id="basic">Basic Facts About Penguins</h1>
        <p>Penguins are aquatic, <em>flightless</em> birds that are highly adapted to life in the water. Their distinct tuxedo-like appearance is called countershading, a form of camouflage that helps keep them safe in the water. Penguins do have wing-bones, though they are flipper-like and extremely suited to swimming. Penguins are found almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, where they catch their food underwater and raise their young on land.</p>

                <li>Fish</li>
                <li>Squid</li>
            </ul>
        <p>In general, penguins closer to the equator eat more fish and penguins closer to Antarctica eat more squid and krill.</p>
